# Final-Project-Group3

- To start run data_preprocess.py, this execution will end up saving 'squad_t5_train.csv' and 'squad_t5_val.csv' in Code folder.
- Now that we have generated SQuaD dataset we can start with training our T5 model.
- Run T5_train.py, this execution will save the model and the tokenizer under the model and tokenizer folder.
- For Evaluation run T5_test.py
- Eventually, run streamlit.py to see the model prediction in action.
- python your_script.py --model_path /path/to/save/model --tokenizer_path /path/to/save/tokenizer
